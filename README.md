# A Blockchain-based Traceability System for the Dairy Industry


The domain in which the proposed idea is being pitched is the dairy industry. Specifically, the proposed idea is a blockchain-based traceability system for the dairy industry, which aims to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient way to track the movement of milk from the farm to the consumer. By using decentralized technology and smart contracts, the proposed system can provide a tamper-proof record of the milk's timestamp, quality, and movement through the supply chain, which can help to ensure the safety and quality of the milk and can support the sustainability of the dairy industry.
